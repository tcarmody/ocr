/// In-memory model of an unpacked EPUB. Complements / will eventually

///
/// `EPUBPackage` is a thin wrapper around a working directory: the
/// editor parses the OPF up-front, then every chapter mutation goes
/// straight to disk through `PackageEditor`. That works, but a partial
/// failure midway through a multi-step op (Merge writes file A, deletes
/// file B, fails to update OPF) leaves the on-disk EPUB inconsistent
/// — and in our case, fatally so, since the editor's URL-keyed buffers
/// then disagree with the spine.
///
/// `EPUBBook` is the Sigil-style alternative: load the entire textual
/// content of the EPUB into memory (XHTML, nav, NCX, CSS), keep the
/// manifest + spine as in-memory mutable state, and only flush to disk
/// in a single `save()` call. Mutations on the in-memory model can't
/// half-corrupt disk; failure just throws and the user retries from a
/// clean snapshot.
///
/// Binary assets (images, fonts) stay on disk — we don't gain anything
/// by loading 50MB of cover art into RAM. Resources with binary content
/// carry a disk URL and are referenced from the book by id; rename/
/// delete operations move the file at save time.

/// This file is the foundation. The PackageEditor migration to operate
/// on `EPUBBook` instead of disk is a follow-up step.
