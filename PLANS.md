# Humanist — Outstanding Plans

A consolidated picture of work remaining on Humanist. Read this first
in any new session — it's the canonical "where do we go from here"
document.

For deep design docs on the AI-assisted structured-document work,
see [Plans/Phase2-Semantic-Classification.md](Plans/Phase2-Semantic-Classification.md)
and [Plans/Phase3-TOC-Parsing.md](Plans/Phase3-TOC-Parsing.md). Both are
deferred for now but fully designed.

## Status snapshot (as of 2026-05-04)

**Done from the original 10-phase plan**:
- Phase 0: notarized python-build-standalone spike
- Phase 1: walking skeleton (drop PDF → Vision OCR → EPUB)
- Phase 2: embedded text extraction + quality scoring
- Phase 3: Tesseract integration (linked via C API, not the CLI)
- Phase 4: Surya layout sidecar + per-region cascade
- Phase 5: footnote detection + EPUB 3 popup linking
- Phase 7: bulk job queue + drag-drop folders + GRDB-free persistence
- Phase 8: side-by-side editor (PDF / source / preview, linked nav)

**Done above the original plan** (quality + robustness):
- Two-up scan detection + auto-split pipeline
- Memory hardening (per-page autoreleasepool, periodic PDF reload,
  shared Surya sidecar singleton, editor deinit)
- Header / footer reclassification (per-page heuristic + page-number
  bypass + cross-page recurrence pass)
- Footnote heuristic for `.text` regions Surya mislabeled
- Region splitting at internal gap (Surya-merged body+footnote)
- Heading reading-order correction (top-of-page headings Surya
  ordered after body)
- ChapterSplitter — flat block stream → multi-chapter Book IR

**Remaining from the original 10-phase plan**:
- Phase 6 — Figure extraction (images dropped today)
- Phase 9 — Language extensibility (RTL: Hebrew / Syriac / Coptic)
- Phase 10 — Polish + distribution (Sparkle, DMG, bundled Python)

**Deferred (designed, not built)**:
- Structured-doc Phase 2 — semantic chapter classification
- Structured-doc Phase 3 — PDF TOC parsing

# Tier 1: Immediate quality gaps

Things the user has either flagged or will flag the next time they
open an academic / illustrated book.

## P6 — Figure extraction

**Status**: not started. Surya emits `.picture`, `.table`, `.formula`
regions; `RegionAwareReflow.bodyKinds` filters them out and we
silently drop every image in every book.

### Goal

Extract figures from each page (vector-first, raster fallback) and
embed them in the EPUB at the correct reading position with the
correct caption.

### Approach

```
PDFIngest/FigureExtractor.swift     vector + raster extraction
Pipeline/CaptionAssociator.swift    pair `.picture` with nearby `.caption`
Pipeline/RegionAwareReflow.swift    add .figure case to Block; emit in stream
Document/Block.swift                + case figure(href, alt, caption)
EPUB/EPUBBuilder.swift              copy image bytes to OEBPS/images/
EPUB/XHTMLWriter.swift              render <figure><img/><figcaption/></figure>
```

**Vector-first extraction**: walk each page's `CGPDFContentStream` for
image XObjects whose bbox intersects the `.picture` region. When
filter is `/DCTDecode` or `/FlateDecode` over an image, we can extract
the original PNG/JPEG bytes losslessly. This is preferred — the
source publisher's scan stays intact.

**Raster fallback**: when the vector path doesn't return a usable
image (vector-drawn diagrams, embedded SVG, encrypted streams), crop
the rendered page raster to the region's bbox + a small margin and
write as PNG.

**Caption association**: Surya emits `.caption` regions adjacent to
`.picture`. Heuristic — a caption belongs to the figure whose bbox is
closest above (Western convention) or closest below (some fields
caption-below). Detect orientation from the first 5 figures; apply
consistently across the book.

### Tricky bits

1. **Cropping margins**: tight bbox crops cut text off the figure;
   loose crops bleed into adjacent body. Use Surya's bbox + 2% of
   page height padding, then trim using ink-density to find true
   edges.
2. **DPI choice for raster fallback**: 200 DPI is plenty for body
   figures; full-page plates need 300+. Use the source page's
   render DPI.
3. **Multi-figure layouts**: a single `.picture` region may contain
   several sub-figures with their own captions ("Fig. 3a / 3b /
   3c"). Detect via internal whitespace; split into multiple
   `.figure` blocks.
4. **Figures spanning a page break**: rare in scanned books but
   possible. Detect via aspect ratio of the picture region — if it
   abuts the bottom of one page and a similar region abuts the top
   of the next, they're likely one figure. Defer this.
5. **Cover image**: if the first page is dominated by a single
   `.picture` region, treat it as the cover. Add to OPF
   `properties="cover-image"` metadata.

### Testing

- Unit: `FigureExtractor` against synthetic PDFs with embedded
  PNG/JPEG XObjects.
- Unit: `CaptionAssociator` against synthetic region layouts.
- Integration: convert a known illustrated book (art-history
  monograph), verify all figures appear in the right positions
  in Apple Books, captions render correctly under each figure.
- Snapshot: EPUB image manifest size + count.

### Risks

- **Some PDFs have no image XObjects** — content was stamped down
  as the page itself. Raster fallback covers this.
- **Image rights**: embedded figures from copyrighted books carry
  the original publisher's rights. The app converts for personal
  use; document this in the README.
- **EPUB filesize bloat**: a 400-page art book at 300 DPI is ~80
  MB of figures. Acceptable; some readers complain past 500 MB.

### Effort estimate

~3 days: extractor + associator + Block/XHTML/EPUB plumbing + tests
+ corpus validation.

### Dependencies

None. Self-contained. Could ship next.

---

## P-Tables — Table extraction

**Status**: not started. Surya emits `.table` regions; we drop them.

### Goal

When Surya identifies a `.table` region, emit an actual EPUB
`<table>` with the right cells, not a dropped region or a flattened
paragraph.

### Approach

Two paths:

**Path A: Surya's table-recognition mode** (preferred). Surya OCR
ships a `surya-table` model that returns row/column cell structure
in addition to the bbox. Wire it into the sidecar as a third
operation alongside layout + OCR.

**Path B: heuristic from observation positions**. Cluster
observations within a `.table` region by Y position to identify rows,
then by X position within rows to identify columns. Brittle on tables
with merged cells; acceptable as a first-pass.

### EPUB output

```html
<table role="table">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Author</th><th>Year</th><th>Edition</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Foucault</td><td>1971</td><td>Gallimard</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Risks

- Tables in scanned books are notoriously difficult. Expect 60-70%
  cell accuracy on first pass.
- Merged cells, rotated headers, and split tables across pages all
  need handling later.

### Effort estimate

~3 days for path A (Surya table model integration), ~2 days for
path B fallback, ~1 day for EPUB plumbing + tests. Total ~5-6 days.

### Dependencies

None hard, but Phase 6 figures should ship first — same XHTML
plumbing patterns.

---

## P-Math — Math / formula handling

**Status**: not started. Surya emits `.formula` regions; we drop them.

### Goal

Render math content from `.formula` regions as either MathML (best
for screen readers + EPUB 3 compliance) or as a rendered PNG of the
formula (universal compatibility, lossy for accessibility).

### Approach

**Easy path**: treat `.formula` regions as `.figure` (raster crop +
emit as `<img>`). Works on any reader, no math markup needed. Loses
the actual math semantics but at least doesn't drop the region.

**Hard path**: pluggable math OCR. Mathpix has an API. Latex-OCR is
open-source. Output → MathML → embed inline.

Recommendation: ship the easy path now (image embed) as part of
Phase 6 (essentially treating `.formula` as a kind of `.picture`),
revisit MathML if a corpus actually needs it.

### Effort estimate

~0.5 day on top of Phase 6.

### Dependencies

Phase 6 (figures) — same plumbing.

---

# Tier 2: Language + corpus expansion

## P9 — RTL languages: Hebrew, Syriac, Coptic

**Status**: not started. Architecture supports it; no work done.

### Goal

OCR + render Hebrew, Syriac, Coptic, and similar RTL / mixed-script
texts. Output EPUBs render with `dir="rtl"` blocks and correct
glyph order for each script.

### Scope

In:
- `heb_best.traineddata` (Hebrew)
- `syr_best.traineddata` (Syriac)
- `cop_best.traineddata` (Coptic — Bohairic + Sahidic both rendered
  by the same data)
- BCP-47 language codes added to language picker (`he`, `syr`, `cop`)
- `RegionRouter` updated to send these to Tesseract preferentially
  (Vision is weak on these scripts)
- `XHTMLWriter` per-block `dir="rtl"` when block's dominant
  language is RTL
- `EPUBBuilder` per-document `<spine page-progression-direction="rtl">`
  when the dominant language is RTL
- Bidi text handling: Hebrew with embedded Latin (transliterations)
  needs `<bdo dir="ltr">` wrappers. Detect via Unicode bidi
  classification.
- Bundle a polytonic + Hebrew capable font in OEBPS/fonts (the
  original plan called this out — Noto Serif covers everything).

Out:
- Arabic (different vowel-marking / shaping concerns; bigger lift)
- Devanagari / Sanskrit (different script family entirely; defer)
- Coptic Sahidic vs Bohairic dialectal disambiguation — use the
  same traineddata, accept some confusion

### Tricky bits

1. **Mixed direction within a paragraph**: Hebrew quotation in an
   English paragraph needs `<span dir="rtl">` even when the parent
   block is LTR. Detect via Unicode `BidiClass`; emit spans
   selectively.
2. **Polytonic Greek + Hebrew on the same page** (Septuagint
   editions): each region tagged with its own language; reflow
   handles the rest.
3. **Tesseract lang stacking**: Tesseract can take `heb+lat` to
   handle mixed text, but quality drops vs single-lang. Use
   single-lang per region when layout localizes the boundary;
   fall back to combined when not.
4. **Right-to-left in the editor**: the SwiftUI / WKWebView
   preview pane needs to honor `dir="rtl"`. WKWebView does this
   natively if the XHTML carries the attribute. Verify the source
   pane (CodeMirror) handles RTL editing — recent versions do.

### Testing

- Unit: language routing for `he`/`syr`/`cop` codes.
- Integration: convert a Hebrew Bible page (Aleppo / Leningrad
  facsimile), a Syriac Peshitta page, a Coptic NT page. Ground-
  truth at least the first page.
- Manual: open results in Apple Books and verify glyph order, line
  direction, and font fallback.

### Risks

- **Tesseract `heb_best` accuracy on mediaeval / palaeographical
  scans is mediocre**. Same caveat as polytonic Greek (the
  original plan's risk #2). For high-quality output, may need to
  train custom data on a corpus we have access to.
- **Bidi rendering bugs in EPUB readers**. Apple Books handles
  most cases; some Kobo / Thorium edge cases exist for
  Latin-in-RTL spans.

### Effort estimate

- ~1 day: traineddata + language picker plumbing
- ~1 day: RTL block emission + bidi detection
- ~0.5 day: font bundling
- ~1 day: corpus testing on real Hebrew / Syriac / Coptic books
- ~0.5 day: editor-side RTL verification

Total: ~4 days. Less if we accept "working but not perfect" for
the bidi edge cases.

### Dependencies

None hard.

---

## P-Greek-Quality — Polytonic Greek accuracy spike

**Status**: not started. The original plan's risk #2.

### Goal

Measure Tesseract `grc_best` Character Error Rate against
hand-corrected ground truth on a real classical-text corpus. If
CER > 5%, evaluate alternatives (TrOCR, GOT-OCR2, fine-tuned
custom traineddata).

### Approach

1. Pick 5-10 ground-truth pages (Loeb, OCT, Teubner, papyri).
2. Run them through the existing Tesseract path; capture output.
3. Hand-correct each page in a separate text file.
4. Compute CER using a standard library (jiwer in Python or
   Swift equivalent).
5. If CER < 3%, ship as-is.
6. If CER 3-5%, document the limitation and continue.
7. If CER > 5%, evaluate replacement — Microsoft TrOCR has
   classical Greek checkpoints; Surya's OCR model handles
   polytonic better than Tesseract on some pages.

### Effort estimate

~2 days for the measurement and decision. Implementation of an
alternative, if needed, is a separate ~5-day project.

### Dependencies

None.

---

# Tier 3: Distribution + polish

## P10 — Distribution

**Status**: app is signed and runs locally. Not packaged for
distribution. Surya runtime relies on a separate `uv tool install
surya-ocr` step on the user's machine.

### Goal

A user downloads a single notarized DMG, drags `Humanist.app` to
`/Applications`, double-clicks. Conversion works without any
additional setup. App auto-updates via Sparkle.

### Sub-deliverables

#### 10.A — Bundle the Python sidecar runtime

Today the sidecar uses `~/.local/share/uv/tools/surya-ocr/bin/python`
auto-detected at runtime. Move to a self-contained bundle:

- Vendor `python-build-standalone` (CPython 3.12 arm64 relocatable)
  into `Resources/python/`.
- Pre-install Surya + PyTorch into a frozen venv in
  `Resources/python/lib/python3.12/site-packages/`.
- Pre-download Surya weights to `Resources/surya-models/`; set
  `HF_HOME` so the app never tries the network.
- `Scripts/bundle-python.sh` — automate the assembly.
- `Scripts/sign-embedded-binaries.sh` — walk the bundle tree and
  individually code-sign every Mach-O (`.so`, `.dylib`, executable).
  Notarization fails on the first unsigned binary.
- Required entitlement:
  `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` (per the
  original plan — friendlier to notarization than the
  unsigned-executable-memory entitlement).

Bundle size: ~1.8 GB total. Acceptable for direct distribution.

This is the single biggest risk in distribution work. The original
plan called this out as risk #1; the spike (Phase 0) verified it's
possible but the production wiring isn't done.

#### 10.B — Bundle Tesseract + traineddata

Today Tesseract is linked against `/opt/homebrew/lib/libtesseract.5.dylib`
on the user's machine. Move to vendored:

- Build `libtesseract` (5.4+) and `libleptonica` (1.84+) from source
  for arm64, output to `Vendor/tesseract/`.
- `install_name_tool -id @rpath/libtesseract.5.dylib …` post-build.
- Ship `_best` variants of `eng`, `grc`, `lat` in `Resources/tessdata/`.
  Add `heb`, `syr`, `cop` if Phase 9 has shipped.
- Code-sign every dylib in the build script.

#### 10.C — DMG assembly

- `Scripts/build-dmg.sh` — produce a DMG with a background image,
  `/Applications` symlink, and the .app bundle.
- Notarize via `notarytool`. Staple the ticket.

#### 10.D — Sparkle for in-app updates

- Vendor Sparkle 2.x.
- `appcast.xml` hosted somewhere (GitHub Pages is fine).
- Generate update on each release; Sparkle handles delta + signature
  verification.

#### 10.E — README + user docs

- Brief README at the repo root explaining what the app does.
- A user guide PDF (or Markdown rendered to a built-in Help menu)
  covering: drag-drop, queue, editor, language picker, two-up
  detection, the high-accuracy mode toggle.
- A developer guide for adding language support.

### Effort estimate

- 10.A: ~3 days (the spike work plus production hardening)
- 10.B: ~1.5 days
- 10.C: ~0.5 day
- 10.D: ~1 day
- 10.E: ~1 day
- End-to-end testing on a clean Mac: ~0.5 day

Total: ~7-8 days.

### Risks

- **The Python bundle**: the spike worked but bundle is the riskiest
  long-tail thing in the project. Plan time for "find which `.so`
  Apple's notary doesn't like; iterate."
- **Bundle size**: ~1.8 GB is fine for direct download but rules
  out App Store distribution forever.
- **Sparkle update hosting**: needs a stable URL. GitHub Pages
  works for free but requires manual upload.

### Dependencies

None hard. 10.A and 10.B are independent; 10.C-D require both
to be done.

---

# Tier 4: Quality refinements

These are smaller items that follow naturally from work we've done.

## R-Footers — Cross-page running-footer recurrence

**Status**: cross-page recurrence is implemented for top-zone running
heads. Symmetrically applies to bottom-zone running footers but the
code today only operates on the top zone.

### Goal

Apply the same cross-page recurrence logic to the bottom zone so
recurring "Stoicheia I.iii" or chapter-bottom labels get tagged as
`.pageFooter` instead of `.text`.

### Approach

`RegionAwareReflow.classifyTopRegionsByRecurrence` becomes
`classifyEdgeRegionsByRecurrence` and runs once for each edge zone.
Symmetric thresholds.

### Effort

~0.5 day. Pure refactor + tests.

---

## R-Hierarchy — Multi-level chapter / section / part structure

**Status**: ChapterSplitter only splits at H1. H2 and H3 headings
become inline content in the chapter rather than nested nav entries.

### Goal

Detect a hierarchy (Part → Chapter → Section → Subsection) from H1 /
H2 / H3 boundaries and emit a nested EPUB nav.

### Approach

Walk the block stream. H1 starts a chapter (existing behavior). H2
within a chapter becomes a "section" within the chapter's nav entry.
nav.xhtml emits nested `<ol>` accordingly.

Optionally: split very long chapters into separate XHTML files at H2
boundaries (some EPUB readers struggle with 100-page chapters).

### Effort

~1 day.

### Dependencies

Naturally combines with Phase 3 (TOC parsing) — TOCs typically
encode the same hierarchy.

---

## R-Custom-Styles — Per-book CSS / fonts

**Status**: every EPUB ships with the same minimal `book.css`. No
per-book customization.

### Goal

Editor pane that lets the user choose a font + size + color theme,
preview it live in the WKWebView, save into the book's CSS.

### Effort

~1 day for a basic font picker + serif/sans toggle. More for a
real theming system.

---

## R-Search — Full-text search in the editor

**Status**: editor has CodeMirror's built-in find but it's limited
to the current pane.

### Goal

Cross-chapter search that returns hits with context, jumps to the
matching XHTML location.

### Effort

~1.5 days.

---

## R-Library — Library browser window

**Status**: Recents menu shows last 10 opened EPUBs. No full library
view.

### Goal

A library window listing every EPUB the user has converted, with
thumbnails (from the cover image — depends on Phase 6), filter by
language, sort by last-opened.

### Effort

~2 days.

### Dependencies

Phase 6 (cover image extraction).

---

## R-Bulk-Editor — Bulk editor operations

**Status**: editor operates on one EPUB at a time. No way to apply
the same change across many converted books.

### Goal

Operations like "re-OCR every page in language X" or "replace this
phrase across these N books" — useful when a corpus update is
needed without redoing every book individually.

### Effort

~3 days.

---

# Tier 5: Performance + observability

## P-Surya-Pool — Multiple Surya sidecars for parallelism

**Status**: one shared Surya sidecar serves all pipelines. Sequential
per page. The bulk runner serializes books anyway, so this is fine
today.

### Goal

If we ever want to convert multiple books in parallel (or process
more pages per second on a single book), pool 2-4 Surya sidecars.
Each loads ~5 GB of weights; pool size is bounded by physical
memory.

### Approach

`SuryaConnectionPool` with a fixed size; round-robin or
least-loaded dispatch.

### Effort

~1 day.

### Dependencies

JobRunner concurrency change (currently single-job).

---

## P-Vision-Concurrency — Overlap Vision OCR with Surya layout

**Status**: per-page work is serial: render → Vision → Surya layout →
cascade.

### Goal

Render → start Vision and Surya in parallel → join when both done.
~30% per-page speedup.

### Effort

~0.5 day. Just `async let` in the per-page loop.

---

## P-Shared-Memory — Surya IPC via shared memory

**Status**: PNG encoded → tmpfile → Python reads. ~50ms per page of
overhead.

### Goal

Pass image bytes via POSIX shared memory or via a memory-mapped
file. Python decodes from the buffer directly.

### Effort

~2 days. Probably not worth it on Apple Silicon — the tmpfile
hits APFS's compressed pages and is fast enough.

---

## O-Telemetry — Optional telemetry

**Status**: original plan said no telemetry. Still appropriate for
personal use.

If ever distributed more widely:
- Crash reporter (Sentry / Bugsnag / Apple's built-in).
- Optional usage telemetry (gated on a Settings opt-in).

Keep no-telemetry-by-default. Document it in the README.

---

# Tier 6: Testing + CI

## T-CI — GitHub Actions CI

**Status**: `swift test` runs locally; nothing in CI.

### Goal

Every push runs `swift test`. PR badges. Optional notarization on
release tags.

### Effort

~0.5 day.

---

## T-Snapshot-EPUBs — EPUB snapshot tests

**Status**: have unit + integration tests but no EPUB-output
snapshots. A regression in OPF / nav / XHTML structure shows up
only when manually inspecting outputs.

### Goal

Snapshot the structure of generated EPUBs for fixture inputs.
Stored in the repo; diffs surface regressions.

### Effort

~1 day.

---

## T-Memory-Regression — Memory regression test

**Status**: 100 GB leak found and fixed empirically. No automated
test prevents recurrence.

### Goal

A test that converts N books in sequence and asserts the host
process's RSS doesn't grow past a threshold. Run on demand
(too slow for every test run).

### Effort

~1 day.

---

## T-Real-Corpus — Real-corpus regression suite

**Status**: tests use synthetic fixtures. Real-world quality is
verified manually.

### Goal

A separate `TestDocuments/` repo (kept out of the app repo for
size reasons; per the original plan) with hand-corrected ground
truth for the first 5 pages of a representative corpus. CER /
WER tracked across releases so accuracy regressions surface
automatically.

### Effort

~3 days for a 10-book corpus + ground truth + CI integration.

---

# Tier 7: Stretch / speculative

## S-Apple-Intelligence-Polish

When macOS 26+ becomes the realistic minimum, use Foundation Models
(see [Plans/Phase2-Semantic-Classification.md](Plans/Phase2-Semantic-Classification.md))
for chapter classification. Cleaner than cloud Claude and free.

## S-OCR-Accuracy-LLM-Pass

Optional post-OCR pass that sends each page's text to Claude Haiku
asking "is this OCR output coherent? If not, here are the
characters you might have misread; please correct." Cost: ~$0.01
per book. Latency: a few seconds per page.

## S-Custom-Footnote-Style

EPUB 3 popup footnotes can be styled per-publisher (margin notes,
inline notes, etc.). Could expose this as a per-book setting.

## S-Audio-Output

EPUB 3 supports Media Overlays (audio synced to text). Could
generate using Apple's `AVSpeechSynthesizer` and bundle the audio
with the EPUB. Niche but unique.

---

# Recommended ordering

If picking up from here cold, this is roughly the order I'd tackle
things in. The user's stated priorities are quality output + personal
use; distribution is lower priority than correctness.

1. **Phase 6 (figures + tables + math-as-image)** — biggest visible
   gap. ~5-6 days for figures + tables. Math-as-image included.
2. **Phase 9 (RTL + Hebrew/Syriac/Coptic)** — opens up a substantial
   corpus. ~4 days.
3. **R-Hierarchy** (multi-level chapters) — natural follow-on to
   ChapterSplitter, low effort. ~1 day.
4. **R-Footers** (cross-page running footers) — symmetric refactor.
   ~0.5 day.
5. **Defer Phase 10 (distribution)** until the user actually wants
   to share or onboard another machine. The app is signed and runs
   locally; that's enough for personal use.
6. **AI-assisted Phase 2/3** — pick up when the user wants
   structured TOCs or semantic landmarks. Existing plans in
   `/Plans/`.

Total Tier 1 + 2: ~10-12 days for substantial quality + corpus
expansion. After that the app handles essentially any book a
working researcher would feed it.
